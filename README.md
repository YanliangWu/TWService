# TWService
TW Service, this contains 2 part, a flask web service that accepts CLI, or a command line interface to do one-off request handling. 

## Assumptions
Currently there are some assumptions: 
- We require user to specify the id to update/delete the record.
- When update record, fields that user did not set, will not be updated. 


## TODO LIST
- Python timestamp -> MySQL timestamp
- ~~DML should check if the original record is there before proceed.~~
- Exception handling is broken, need to have better try catch block. 
- ~~Config to connect to database~~
- Fix service, currently it is broken due to some interface changes
- Unit Tests


#### Good to have
- Keep the update history by using knowledge time model 
- Entitlement Check
- Containerlize this and move to k8s
- WSGI for service
- MySQL connection
- CORS?


## Effort Log
- Aug 18: 11:30 - 1:40AM (Aug19)
  - Create service, create a in memory DAO for testing
- Aug 20: 11:30 - 3:00 AM (Aug21)
  - Create CLI, Mysql connector, formatting, documents, bug fixes.

## Swagger Doc
Check swagger.json for swagger document, this is only for the service only.
